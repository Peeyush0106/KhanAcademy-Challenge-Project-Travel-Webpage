        Silicon Valley is a region in the southern part of the San Francisco Bay Area in Northern California that
        serves as a global center for high technology and innovation. It corresponds roughly to the geographical
        Santa Clara Valley.
        <br>
        <br>
        San Jose is Silicon Valley's largest city, the third-largest in California, and the tenth-largest in the
        United States; other major Silicon Valley cities include Sunnyvale, Santa Clara, Redwood City, Mountain
        View, Palo Alto, Menlo Park, and Cupertino.
        <br>
        <br>
        The San Jose Metropolitan Area has the third-highest GDP per capita in the world (after Zurich, Switzerland
        and Oslo, Norway), according to the Brookings Institution.

    <h3 class="End-Part-Heading">Get around</h3>
    <p class="End-Part">
        Its quite possible to see Santa Clara and San Jose by public transport and walking. Outside of those cities, the
        best way to travel in Silicon Valley is car due to weak public transportation infrastructure (though not during
        rush hours).

    <ul class="End-Part">
        <li>
            People sometimes visit company headquarters in Sillicon Valley so they can take a photo at them.
        </li>
        <li>
            Major points of interest include the Tech Museum of Innovation in San Jose and the Computer History
            Museum in
            Mountain View, as well as Stanford University's campus just south of Palo Alto.
